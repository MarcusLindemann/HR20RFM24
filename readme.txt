This is a fork of the OpenHR20 project to add support for the RF24L01 wireless chip. The original lives at http://sourceforge.net/projects/openhr20/, but seems to be abandoned.

Branches
========

master		The main line, releases are coming from here
rfmsrc		The RFM12 support line from the original OpenHR20, might be merged to master later on. This branch is for historic purposes only.
RF24L01_devel	Development branch for the RF24L01 support.
